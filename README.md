# Donut.c

This project contains a C program that generates an animated ASCII art donut. The animation is displayed in the terminal and continuously rotates to create a 3D effect.

## Features

- Generates an animated ASCII art donut.
- Continuously rotates to create a 3D effect.
- Uses trigonometric functions and simple physics to simulate the rotation.

## Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`).
- A terminal that supports ANSI escape codes.

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```sh
